# Hand Gesture Recognition

This project is focused on recognizing hand gestures using computer vision techniques. The main code for this project is contained in the `index.py` file.

## About

The `index.py` script captures video from a webcam, processes the frames to detect and recognize hand gestures, and displays the results in real-time. The project utilizes libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow for image processing and machine learning.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handGesture.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd handGesture
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the `index.py` script to start the hand gesture recognition:
